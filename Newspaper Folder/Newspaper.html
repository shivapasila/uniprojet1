</div>
<p>Over the last few years, tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed over several things, including Artificial Intelligence and rockets. But now they are set to compete in an unusual space!
Last month, Musk caused an almighty stir when he challenged his fellow billionaire and Facebook founder Zuckerberg to meet him in a cage fight. And social media has been buzzing since Zuckerberg took up the gauntlet. It is being speculated that the fight will be held at the Colosseum in Italy — it may most likely be an exhibition match.
Even as the world is excited about the face-off between the two giants, experts believe that the event will push the sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MAA) and bring it more visibility.</p>

<p><span class="headline hl12">Meta fires employee after nearly 10 years of service, she says
it felt like losing a part of her identity </span></p></div>
<p>Meta fired an employee who was about to complete 10 years at the company.
The ex-Meta executive said that most of her identity was wrapped up in her job and that
she doesn't know what she brings to the table now that she is no longer working at Mark Zuckerberg's company.</p>
<P>long with the pink slips, Meta has implemented other cost-cutting measures as it grapples 
with soaring costs and dipping ad revenues. The company plans to cut discretionary spending 
and extend its hiring freeze through the first quarter.But it has not specified the impacted regions
or the expected cost savings from the moves.</P>
<p>t is undoubtedly the dream of most working professionals to have a 
job that they not only excel at, but also love. But when you are handed the pink slip at your dream job,
it can leave you feeling immensely upset. Something similar happened with a Meta employee who lost her job 
during the company's large-scale layoffs. She had been working for Meta for over 10 years and said in a 
LinkedIn post that most of her identity revolved around her job.</p>

<p><span class="headline hl14">All of us have flaws. Specific problems that need fixing but you don't know how? 
Luckily, astrology has the solutions for it all. Let's find out.</span></p></div>
<P>Aries: Your need for attention and recognition causes many problems. Being a fire sign, you are naturally assertive
but it is not necessary for people to always validate your ideas and thoughts.Though your reasons might be genuine
the need for all of them to be appreciated or accepted might come off as selfish to others. As a solution, try responding rather than reacting. 
Listen to what others are saying and project yourselves according to the situation.</P>
<p>Gemini: Your sign faces criticism for being two-faced. Though it is natural for you to 
be an extrovert and blend with new people. <br>But it might be really scary for your friends. 
You may be written as superficial and it might be hard for people to trust you. <br>Try living for more than just the moment, 
Gemini. You need real connections in life so try spending time with good-hearted people.</p>

<p>"I Walked Out Of My Crease...": Australia Star Makes Stunning Jonny Bairstow Revelation From First Ashes Test
Jonny Bairstow and Travis Head in a chat© Twitter Since the controversial dismissal of England wicket-keeper batter 
Jonny Bairstow on Day 5 of the Lord's Test,
the cricketing fraternity is divided in deciding if it was right for Australia to play by the 'rules of the game' 
but keep the 'spirit of the game' aside. While England captain Ben Stokes said that he wouldn't want to win the game
in such a manner, Australia batter Travis Head has revealed that Bairstow tired to dismiss him in the same manner
during the Edgbaston Test, and the two even had a chat about it.</p>
<p>And the ball got whipped in, and I quickly whipped my bat back and questioned Jonny: would you take the stumps?
And he said, 'Bloody oath I would,' and ran off," he added.</p>
